            <p class="paragraph">Logo created for the Electronics, Process Instrumentation and Computer Club at Delaware
                Technical Community College. Visual mark combines elements that represent the analog space of
                electronics and digital space of computer language inside a process of iteration and refinement.
                Typography is informed by the brackets in the visual logo, and by the binary language to further unify
                the analog and digital identities of the club.</p>
            <h3 class="heading3">Process</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The project started out just writing out the name of the club in many different
                variations to understand the geometry of the letters and how they affect the space around them. This
                lead to exploring unique and flexible options from which to pull. After the initial idea generation for
                word variations I moved on to exploring the visual mark. Incorporating the technical aspect about the
                EPIC club was very important here. A certain level of abstraction needed to be maintained so members and
                non-members could identify the logo and associate it with any type of technical topic that could be of
                interest to the Club. After a healthy amount of exploration, the logo eventually came down to using two
                rounded brackets with white stripes down the middle with two arrow points on opposite ends and a smaller
                lightning bolt through the middle. This best captured the process of working with electronics and
                computer code in such an abstract way that it could be applied to anything with an electronic circuit or
                computer code. The typography came shortly after; declining to use a pre-existing sans-serif typeface in
                favor of a series of modified vertical bars and curves. Directly taking influence from the brackets in
                the visual mark to convey a bar code and binary esque appearance. This gave the wordmark good unity with
                the visual mark and a good stand alone identity if used by itself.</p>
            <h3 class="heading3">Analysis</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">A large amount of my decision making and design choice came from the EPIC clubs focus
                on technical areas of study, relating to electronics and computer code. Each previous iteration led me
                to a simpler and broader representation of the club logo in order to accommodate for a wider range of
                programs and activities. The colors were inspired by transistor color coding and for the sake of
                simplicity only two colors were used in execution. This also ensured that no information was lost if
                used in black and white, making the logo fully accessible to color blind students. Overall this logo was
                chosen because it represented a level of technical abstraction in an easily digestible form that
                different types of students and faculty could understand.</p>
