            <p class="paragraph">Glassbox is a legislation tracking app that provides information and status of
                legislation
                moving through Congress. A detailed view of the legislation is also provided if the user wants to read
                specific parts of the document. In order to keep Bills relevant to users an interest filter provides a
                quick
                and easy way to sift out all of the unwanted legislation. In addition social media tools provide a way
                for
                users to share information with friends or to reach out to representatives to voice opinions.</p>
            <h3 class="heading3">Process</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Project development began with the gathering and analysis of pre-existing applications
                that
                provide the same or similar functionality as Glassbox. Observations about features, shortcomings and
                interactions were made during brief usage periods for several web applications revolving around
                legislation
                tracking, campaign finance and representative voting history. This preliminary observational research in
                addition to developing a working hypothesis, target user groups and personas laid the groundwork for
                building a solid informational architecture for the app. This led to creating wireframes and early
                testing
                with InVision in order to fine tune user flows and further develop app interaction, interface elements
                and
                features. Currently the app is going through a cycle of user feedback using the InVision prototyping
                tool
                and focus groups from the target user population.</p>
            <h3 class="heading3">Analysis</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">At the start of the project, basic mobile design patterns were implemented in order to
                add
                to user knowledge about the product and specific features intended for implementation. The first was an
                onboarding process starting directly after the user signs up or signs in. Its goal was to inform the
                user
                about the features of the app and give an overview of how it can be used. This was eventually replaced
                with
                a simple form which prompts the user to enter their hobbies and interests that relate to them. From here
                the
                app then catalogs and tracks legislation based on the interests entered and presents only relevant
                legislation to the user. This complicates the system programming but allows a more straightforward and
                direct means for users to get value out of the app. Visually the approach from wireframes to the current
                version has always kept a clean and clear hierarchy of interface elements in order to maximize
                readability
                and minimize confusion. Basic blue, white, grey and red colors were added in order to further
                differentiate
                elements but unify the design and brand as whole. These colors were chosen because of their symbolism
                and
                political importance in the United States while trying to be as politically neutral as possible. The
                legislation detail page which allows users to read bills is proving to be the most difficult feature to
                implement given the constraints of a mobile environment. Currently it is under review for elimination or
                pivoting based on the results of further user testing.</p>
